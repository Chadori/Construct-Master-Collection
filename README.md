# Construct Master Collection
This is the dedicated repository for the Construct :: Master Collection developed by ChadoriXD. 
You can post here the feature requests and bug issues you want to officially file. 

## Tip
You can also verify your issues, feature requests in realtime through the Discord Server.
This makes work and the filtering, faster.

## Sending a Bug Report
Please always include the steps to reproduce the issue with a demo project.
This makes it faster to find and fix the issue and faster to advice you if there isn't one.

## Sending a Feature Request
You can post a feature request here if you are confident it is a good addition to the collection,
while also practically beneficial to the users.
If you are unsure of a certain feature you wish to propose, please discuss first in the Discord Server. 

## Express Feature Requests
These are paid orders so these will be be given top priority.
You don't have to post here. I will manage the express orders.
