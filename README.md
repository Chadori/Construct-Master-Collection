# Construct Master Collection
This is the dedicated repository for the Construct Master Collection, developed by ChadoriXD. 
You can post here the feature requests and bug issues you want to officially file. 

## Tip
You can verify your issues, feature requests in realtime through the Discord Server.
This makes work and filtering faster.

## Sending a Bug Report
Please always include the steps to reproduce the issue with a demo project.
This makes it faster to find and fix the problem and faster to advice you the solution if there isn't one.

## Sending a Feature Request
You can post a feature request here if you are confident it is a good addition to the collection while also practical 
and beneficial to the other users.
If you are unsure of a certain feature you wish to propose, please discuss it first in the Discord Server. 

## Express Feature Requests
These are paid orders, which are given top priority development and support.
You don't have to post here. I will manage the express orders.
